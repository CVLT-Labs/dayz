## Deer Isle Snippets
This repository is a collection of snippets that I've found helpful or wish I was able to find when putting together a Day Z server.  
I offer them to you _(the community)_ in hopes that someone else finds them useful as well.

**cfgundergroundtriggers.json**  
Defines the "darkness" area of the Mine in the south east of Deer Isle. It's not perfect, but it'll get you pretty close.  
  
**groceryStore.xml**  
A list of coordinates for the grocery stores throughout Deer Isle, also included is a custom event that should spawn more food at each location.
